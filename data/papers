We study the task of sampling\nfrom the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural\ntask for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution\nclassically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with\ncomputational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is\ntypical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational\ncomplexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential\ntime in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime\nusing extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42\nqubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational\ntask that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are\nextremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the\nnear-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross\nentropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the\ncircuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured\nwhen circuit simulations are available.

A\nkey step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation\nbeyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum\nsupremacy. Here, using 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate\npath towards quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we\nare able to generate thousands of unique Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the\noutput probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution,\nconsistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert-space. As the number of\nqubits in the algorithm is varied, the system continues to explore the\nexponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with\ntechniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which\naccurately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application\nof these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observing a\ntransition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these\nresults to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that\nare beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.",

Because of this, the wavefunction cannot be shown to\ndescribe an ensemble of deterministic states where uncertainty simply reflects\na lack of knowledge about which ensemble member describes reality. This has led\nto endless debates about the ontology of quantum mechanics.\n  Here we derive these same quantum properties from number theoretic attributes\nof trigonometric functions applied to an explicitly ensemble-based\nrepresentation of discretised complex Hilbert states. To avoid fine-tuning, the\nmetric on state space must be $p$-adic rather than Euclidean where $1/p$\ndetermines the fineness of the discretisation. This hints at both the existence\nof an underpinning fractal state-space geometry onto which states of the world\nare constrained. In this model, violation of Bell inequalities is a\nmanifestation of this geometric constraint and does not imply a breakdown of\nlocal space-time causality.\n  Because the discretised wavefunction describes an ensemble of states, there\nis no collapse of the wavefunction. Instead measurement describes a nonlinear\nclustering of state-space trajectories on the state-space geometry. In this\nmodel, systems with mass greater than the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum\nproperties and instead behave classically. The geometric constraint suggests\nthat the exponential increase in the size of state space with qubit number may\nbreak down with qubit numbers as small as a few hundred. Quantum mechanics is\nitself a singular limit of this number-theoretic model at $p=\\infty$.

         "abstract": "It is known from quantum mechanics that particles are associated with wave\nfunctions, and that the probability of observing a particle at some future\nlocation is proportional to the squared modulus of the amplitude of its wave\nfunction. Although this statistical relationship is well quantified, the\ninterpretations have remained controversial, with many split between the\nclassical Copenhagen interpretation and some variation of the de Broglie-Bohm\npilot wave models. Recent experiments with Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQAs)\nhave demonstrated that droplets of real fluid may achieve stable dynamical\nstates, where interaction of the droplets with their own ripples results in\nmotion analogous to the motion of particles subject to the guiding equation\nunder the pilot wave models. Indeed, many effects previously thought to be\nexclusively quantum have now been observed as emergent phenomena in these\nmacroscopic HQAs. This has motivated us to explore the possibility that quantum\nmechanics may actually be the result of fluid dynamics on some real quantum\nscale fluid. In this paper, we show that if there is a real quantum scale fluid\nhaving dynamics analogous to the fluid in HQAs, then this fluid must be a\nsuperfluid, and the dynamics of that fluid must take place on the surface of a\n4-dimensional hypersphere. Under the influence of cosmological inflation, we\nfurther show that these bouncing droplets would have the illusion of a property\nanalogous to rest mass, and that the principles of inertia, momentum,\nmass-energy equivalence, general relativity, the uncertainty principle and the\nappearance of a time-like dimension can all be derived for droplets as purely\nemergent phenomena from the fluid dynamics of this system. As such, we believe\nthat this model merits consideration as a potential foundation for a new\nunifying theory of physics at all scales.",

         "abstract": "A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is\nwhether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined\ncomputational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical\ncomputers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling\nfrom the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural\ntask for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution\nclassically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with\ncomputational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is\ntypical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational\ncomplexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential\ntime in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime\nusing extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42\nqubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational\ntask that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are\nextremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the\nnear-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross\nentropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the\ncircuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured\nwhen circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable\nregime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical\nestimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.",
