      "    \"abstract\": \"With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and\\nquantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising\\n\\\"killer\\\" applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect\\nbetween most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the\\ncapabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in\\nthe near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on \\\"What would\\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\\\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this\\ntarget, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such\\nas generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of\\nthe popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also\\nhighlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like\\nstatistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus\\non hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key\\nchallenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the\\nquantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum\\ndevices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of\\nusing quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the\\nQAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of\\ndata, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the\\ntraining of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this\\nconcept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well\\nfrom this hybrid quantum-classical framework.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and\\nquantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising\\n\"killer\" applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect\\nbetween most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the\\ncapabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in\\nthe near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on \"What would\\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this\\ntarget, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such\\nas generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of\\nthe popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also\\nhighlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like\\nstatistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus\\non hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key\\nchallenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the\\nquantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum\\ndevices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of\\nusing quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the\\nQAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of\\ndata, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the\\ntraining of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this\\nconcept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well\\nfrom this hybrid quantum-classical framework.',\n",

There is a gap between the abstract terms in which the\\ntheory is couched and the phenomena the theory enables each of us to account\\nfor so well. Because it has no practical consequences for how we each use\\nquantum mechanics to deal with physical problems, this cognitive dissonance has\\nmanaged to coexist with the quantum theory from the very beginning. The absence\\nof conceptual clarity for almost a century suggests that the problem might lie\\nin some implicit misconceptions about the nature of scientific explanation that\\nare deeply held by virtually all physicists, but are rarely explicitly\\nacknowledged. I describe here such unvoiced but widely shared assumptions.\\nRejecting them clarifies and unifies a range of obscure remarks about quantum\\nmechanics made almost from the beginning by some of the giants of physics, many\\nof whom are held to be in deep disagreement. This new view of physics requires\\nphysicists to think about science in an unfamiliar way. My primary purpose is\\nto explain the new perspective and urge that it be taken seriously. My\\nsecondary aims are to explain why this perspective differs significantly from\\nwhat Bohr, Heisenberg, and Pauli had been saying from the very beginning, and\\nwhy it is not solipsism, as some have maintained. To emphasize that this is a\\ngeneral view of science, and not just of quantum mechanics, I apply it to a\\nlong-standing puzzle in classical physics: the apparent inability of physics to\\ngive any meaning to \\\"Now\\\" --- the present moment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"It is known from quantum mechanics that particles are associated with wave\\nfunctions, and that the probability of observing a particle at some future\\nlocation is proportional to the squared modulus of the amplitude of its wave\\nfunction. Although this statistical relationship is well quantified, the\\ninterpretations have remained controversial, with many split between the\\nclassical Copenhagen interpretation and some variation of the de Broglie-Bohm\\npilot wave models. Recent experiments with Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQAs)\\nhave demonstrated that droplets of real fluid may achieve stable dynamical\\nstates, where interaction of the droplets with their own ripples results in\\nmotion analogous to the motion of particles subject to the guiding equation\\nunder the pilot wave models. Indeed, many effects previously thought to be\\nexclusively quantum have now been observed as emergent phenomena in these\\nmacroscopic HQAs. This has motivated us to explore the possibility that quantum\\nmechanics may actually be the result of fluid dynamics on some real quantum\\nscale fluid. In this paper, we show that if there is a real quantum scale fluid\\nhaving dynamics analogous to the fluid in HQAs, then this fluid must be a\\nsuperfluid, and the dynamics of that fluid must take place on the surface of a\\n4-dimensional hypersphere. Under the influence of cosmological inflation, we\\nfurther show that these bouncing droplets would have the illusion of a property\\nanalogous to rest mass, and that the principles of inertia, momentum,\\nmass-energy equivalence, general relativity, the uncertainty principle and the\\nappearance of a time-like dimension can all be derived for droplets as purely\\nemergent phenomena from the fluid dynamics of this system. As such, we believe\\nthat this model merits consideration as a potential foundation for a new\\nunifying theory of physics at all scales.\",\n",

Here we provide an approachable explanation of\\nquantum physics using simple thought experiments. We derive all relevant\\nquantum predictions using minimal mathematics, without introducing the advanced\\ncalculations that are typically used to describe quantum physics. We focus on\\nthe two key surprises of quantum physics, namely wave-particle duality, a term\\nthat was introduced to capture the fact that single quantum particles in some\\nrespects behave like waves and in other respects like particles, and\\nentanglement, which applies to two or more quantum particles and brings out the\\ninherent contradiction between quantum physics and seemingly obvious\\nassumptions regarding the nature of reality. Following arguments originally\\nmade by John Bell and Lucien Hardy, we show that the so-called local hidden\\nvariables are inadequate at explaining the behavior of entangled quantum\\nparticles. This means that one either has to give up on hidden variables, i.e.,\\nthe idea that the outcomes of measurements on quantum particles are determined\\nbefore an experiment is actually carried out, or one has to relinquish the\\nprinciple of locality, which requires that no causal influences should be\\nfaster than the speed of light and is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of\\nrelativity. Finally, we describe how these remarkable predictions of quantum\\nphysics have been confirmed in experiments.
