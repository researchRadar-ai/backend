      "    \"abstract\": \"With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and\\nquantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising\\n\\\"killer\\\" applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect\\nbetween most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the\\ncapabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in\\nthe near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on \\\"What would\\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\\\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this\\ntarget, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such\\nas generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of\\nthe popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also\\nhighlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like\\nstatistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus\\non hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key\\nchallenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the\\nquantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum\\ndevices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of\\nusing quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the\\nQAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of\\ndata, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the\\ntraining of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this\\nconcept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well\\nfrom this hybrid quantum-classical framework.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and\\nquantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising\\n\"killer\" applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect\\nbetween most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the\\ncapabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in\\nthe near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on \"What would\\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this\\ntarget, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such\\nas generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of\\nthe popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also\\nhighlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like\\nstatistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus\\non hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key\\nchallenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the\\nquantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum\\ndevices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of\\nusing quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the\\nQAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of\\ndata, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the\\ntraining of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this\\nconcept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well\\nfrom this hybrid quantum-classical framework.',\n",

Our cherished notions of\\ncomputation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the\\nphysics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to\\nask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of\\na classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of\\ncomputation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel\\ncryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small\\nquantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are\\nunderway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices,\\nthe quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight\\ninto the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of\\nthe physics of our universe and its connections with computation.\\n  We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of\\na quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of\\na number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and\\nhighlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena\\ndescribed were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was\\nquantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more\\ndramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these\\noddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe\\nnext. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for\\nfuture work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum\\ninformation ultimately comes from.\",\n",

A\\nkey step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation\\nbeyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum\\nsupremacy. Here, using 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate\\npath towards quantum supremacy.

As the number of\\nqubits in the algorithm is varied, the system continues to explore the\\nexponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with\\ntechniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which\\naccurately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application\\nof these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observing a\\ntransition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these\\nresults to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that\\nare beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.\",\n",
